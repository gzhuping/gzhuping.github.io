# Open positions

**Our lab will mainly use computational and theoretical approaches combined with multi-omics high-throughput sequencing data, but also wet-lab experiments when desired, to systematically understand gene regulation, cell differentiation and spatial cell-cell interaction in single cells, with focus on questions in developmental, stem cell biology and immunology.**
**We are always looking for creative, energetic and collaborative researchers to join our interdisciplinary team!**


## Associate Investigator
<p>The candidate will have a Ph.D. in computational biology/bioinformatics/computer science/statistics or another quantitative field, as well as excellent programming and communication skills. Substantial experience in analysis of high-throughput sequencing data is highly desirable.</p>
Candidate with a Ph.D. degree in cell biology, molecular biology, immunology (etc.) with substantial experience and interest in quantitative fields/programming are also welcomed to apply.</p>

<p>The candidate should have ability to develop independent research programs/projects, and candidate with experience in postdoctoral training or research and strong record in research is strongly preferred.</p>

<p>The successful candidate will join a vibrant scientific environment devoted to basic science aiming at integrating research activities among partner institutes and conduct interdisciplinary research to address high-priority projects through the combination of complementary knowledge, methods and techniques.</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining us, please send us an email along with a brief cover letter, a detailed CV and at least two recommendation letters. Please indicate “Application Associate Investigator (Your name)” in the email subject.</p>

## Leiden University master students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office. 

## Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades or a personal recomendation).
