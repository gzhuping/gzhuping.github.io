<p>Age-related muscle atrophy (sarcopenia) is the leading cause for disability in aged population, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we identify a novel role for the secreted glycoprotein Dickkopf 3 (Dkk3) in sarcopenia. Forced expression of Dkk3 in muscles in young mice leads to muscle atrophy. Conversely, reducing its expression in old muscles restores both muscle size and function. Dkk3 induces nuclear import of Î²-catenin and enhances its interaction with FoxO3, which in turn activates the transcription of E3 ubiquitin ligase Fbxo32 and Trim63, driving muscle atrophy. These findings suggest that Dkk3 may be used as diagnostic marker and as therapeutic target for age-related muscle atrophy, and reveal a distinct transcriptional control of Fbxo32 and Trim63.</p>

<!-- Advances in single-cell technologies, especially for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), are providing exciting opportunities for describing the characteristics and heterogeneity of individual cells and benefiting the study of cell identity, fate and function with unprecedented resolution (Stuart and Satija, 2019). Recent studies have also shown that identical cell types may have tissue-specific expression patterns, indicating that tissue environment plays an important role in mediating cell states. The loss of spatial information during the process of tissue dissociation and cell isolation will limit our understanding of cellular interactions and organization in the microenvironment. Recently, a number of methods providing spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling have been introduced and are complementary to scRNA-seq (Asp et al., 2020). Some studies, for example, from development, stem cell, cancer and immunology fields, clearly highlight the power of scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomes for parsing the spatial context in high resolution (Baccin et al., 2020; Moncada et al., 2020). However, due to technical limitations and complexity of data structure, there are some unique computational challenges need to be addressed for advancing the field of single-cell omics
