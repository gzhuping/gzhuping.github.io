- title: Tissue-resident memory and circulating T cells are early responders to pre-surgical cancer immunotherapy
  description: 
    **Background** Most of the microRNAs (MiRs) involved in myogenesis are transcriptional regulated. The role of MiR bio genesis in myogenesis has not been characterized yet. RNA-binding protein Musashi 2 (Msi2) is considered to be one of the major drivers for oncogenesis and stem cell proliferation. The functions of Msi2 in myogenesis have not been explored yet. We sought to investigate Msi2-regulated biogenesis of MiRs in myogenesis and muscle stem cell (MuSC) ageing. **Methods** We detected the expression of Msi2 in MuSCs and differentiated myotubes by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot. Msi2-binding partner human antigen R (HuR) was identifified by immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis. The cooperative binding of Msi2 and HuR on MiR7a-1 was analysed by RNA immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis mobility shift assays. The inhibition of the processing of pri-MiR7a-1 mediated by Msi2 and HuR was shown by Msi2 and HuR knockdown. Immunoflfluorescent staining, RT-qPCR and immunoblotting were used to characterize the function of MiR7a-1 in myogenesis. Msi2 and HuR up-regulate cryptochrome circadian regulator 2 (Cry2) via MiR7a-1 was confifirmed by the luciferase assay and western blot. The post-transcriptional regulatory cascade was further confifirmed by RNAi and overexpressing of Msi2 and HuR in MuSCs, and the in vivo function was characterized by histopathological and molecular biological methods in Msi2 knockout mice. **Results** We identifified a post-transcription regulatory cascade governed by a pair of RNA-binding proteins Msi2 and HuR. Msi2 is enriched in differentiated muscle cells and promotes MuSC differentiation despite its pro-proliferation functions in other cell types. Msi2 works synergistically with another RNA-binding protein HuR to repress the biogenesis of MiR7a-1 in an Msi2 dose-dependent manner to regulate the translation of the key component of the circadian core oscillator complex Cry2. Down-regulation of Cry2 (0.6-fold, vs. control, P < 0.05) mediated by MiR7a-1 represses MuSC differentiation. The disruption of this cascade leads to differentiation defects of MuSCs. In aged muscles, Msi2 (0.3-fold, vs. control, P < 0.01) expression declined, and the Cry2 protein level also decreases (0.5-fold, vs. control, P < 0.05), suggesting that the disruption of the Msi2-mediated post-transcriptional regulatory cascade could attribute to the declined ability of muscle regeneration in aged skeletal muscle. Conclusions Our fifindings have identifified a new post-transcriptional cascade regulating myogenesis. The cascade is disrupted in skeletal muscle ageing, which leads to declined muscle regeneration ability.

- title: Molecular pathways of colon inflammation induced by cancer immunotherapy
  image: colitis.png
  description: 
    Checkpoint blockade with antibodies specific for the PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitory receptors can induce durable responses in a wide range of human cancers. However, the immunological mechanisms responsible for severe inflammatory side effects remain poorly understood. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell analysis of immune cell populations in colitis, a common and severe side effect of checkpoint blockade. We observed a striking accumulation of CD8 T cells with highly cytotoxic and proliferative states and no evidence of regulatory T cell depletion. T cell receptor (TCR) sequence analysis demonstrated that a substantial fraction of colitis-associated CD8 T cells originated from tissue-resident populations, explaining the frequently early onset of colitis symptoms following treatment initiation. Our analysis also identified cytokines, chemokines, and surface receptors that could serve as therapeutic targets for colitis and potentially other inflammatory side effects of checkpoint blockade.

- title: Molecular architecture of lineage allocation and tissue organization in early mouse embryo
  image: embryo.png
  description: 
    During post-implantation development of the mouse embryo, descendants of the inner cell mass in the early epiblast transit from the naive to primed pluripotent state. Fate-mapping and lineage-analysis studies have revealed that cells in different regions of the germ layers acquire location-specific cell fates during gastrulation. However, a genome-wide molecular annotation of lineage segregation and tissue architecture of the post-implantation embryo has yet to be undertaken. Here we report a spatially resolved transcriptome of cell populations at defined positions in the germ layers during development from pre- to late-gastrulation stages. This spatiotemporal transcriptome provides high-resolution digitized in situ gene-expression profiles, reveals the molecular genealogy of tissue lineages and defines the continuum of pluripotency states in time and space. The transcriptome further identifies the networks of molecular determinants that drive lineage specification and tissue patterning, supports a role of Hippoâ€“Yap signalling in germ-layer development and reveals the contribution of visceral endoderm to the endoderm in the early mouse embryo.
